/**
  * [[RasterExtent]] objects represent the geographic extent
  * (envelope) of a raster.
  *
  * The Raster extent has two coordinate concepts involved: map
  * coordinates and grid coordinates. Map coordinates are what the
  * Extent class uses, and specifies points using an X coordinate and
  * a Y coordinate. The X coordinate is oriented along west to east
  * such that the larger the X coordinate, the more eastern the
  * point. The Y coordinate is along south to north such that the
  * larger the Y coordinate, the more Northern the point.
  *
  * This contrasts with the grid coordinate system. The grid
  * coordinate system does not actually reference points on the map,
  * but instead a cell of the raster that represents values for some
  * square area of the map. The column axis is similar in that the
  * number gets larger as one goes from west to east; however, the row
  * axis is inverted from map coordinates: as the row number
  * increases, the cell is heading south. The top row is labeled as 0,
  * and the next 1, so that the highest indexed row is the southern
  * most row of the raster.  A cell has a height and a width that is
  * in terms of map units. You can think of it as each cell is itself
  * an extent, with width cellwidth and height cellheight. When a cell
  * needs to be represented or thought of as a point, the center of
  * the cell will be used.  So when gridToMap is called, what is
  * returned is the center point, in map coordinates.
  *
  * Map points are considered to be 'inside' the cell based on these
  * rules:
  *  - If the point is inside the area of the cell, it is included in
  *    the cell.
  *  - If the point lies on the north or west border of the cell, it
  *    is included in the cell.
  *  - If the point lies on the south or east border of the cell, it
  *    is not included in the cell, it is included in the next
  *    southern or eastern cell, respectively.
  *
  * Note that based on these rules, the eastern and southern borders
  * of an Extent are not actually considered to be part of the
  * RasterExtent.
